# BotCamera
Control a smart camera at home to send you pictures on telegram.

Hardware:
1) Raspberry Pi.. I am using Zero W, makes it easier to control on WiFi
2) Pi Camera.. NoIR one works awesome
3) USB/Power cable

Software:
1) Telepot Library.. Awesome work by @nikoala
2) MP4Box, get it using "sudo apt-get install gpac" before you start the project
3) Telegram Bot Token

Hoping the Pi Board has internet, use this python code to get play in your Telegram Bot
Make your Telegram Bot using "BotFather" bot by Telegram, awesome work there by the Telegram team. I loved this api from them, they have made the life easier. Over that awesome implementation of it by Nick Lee in Telepot.

Try it aut and let me know if you feel more things to be implemented on it. Will be probably adding few more features soon.

Cheers!
